00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to this first video about C

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we are going to make our first program in C, 

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and we’ll call it hello world

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
hello world is often presented when you discover a new language

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
quite simply, we’re going to display “hello world” on screen

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it’s a way to learn the syntax of that language

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
do not worry, in this video I won’t explain everything I type

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
just follow along, and everything will be fine

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the first thing to know is that a computer program

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
before it can be understood by a machine

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
is a text file

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which contains code in a certain language, in our case C

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and can be read by a human

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the second thing to know is that a program has always an entry point

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in C, the entry point is called main

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
all right, let’s start

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have an empty folder and I create a file main.c

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you can give it another name, the important thing here is .c

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and inside there is a main function

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so I type the main function  int main(), and brackets

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
how do you read this, int main is I declare the function

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and in () what the function does

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
by the way a C file is always from top to bottom

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so I have my file main.c

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you can read it with cat

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
this the computer does not understand

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
how do I make it understand?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
simply, I will compile it, I use gcc

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
gcc is a program that reads the .c files

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and transform them into something the computer can understand

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so gcc main.c, it worked

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and now I see a new file called a.out

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can now execute it, as you can see here

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
it’s important to know that this a.out file is not a file that we can read

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you see on screen, there are some things that I can’t understand

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that’s normal, it’s binary, that’s how the computer can execute the program

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
after compilation, you can a file that you can’t read, but you can execute the program

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so we wanted to display hello world

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to prevent compilation problems, I need to add this

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
don’t worry, I won’t explain here, this will be covered in a future video

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
so the compiler will read from top to bottom

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it expects ; after each command

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so her I type printf, printf is a command to display on screen

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
printf hello world

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
between quotes, ; at the end

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
now I compile again with gcc

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I execute, and hello world is displayed

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that’s good

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and if I try without ; at the end

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and again I compile it, I get this

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it’s expecting a ; at the end

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
because this is what ends the command line

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
all right, going back

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as you see there is the command prompt also displayed

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what I would like is the command prompt on the next line

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
how? first idea is to put a line break here with Enter

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but the compiler reads line by line

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and on this line, parenthesis is opened, double quotes, and no ; at the end

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and if I compile, I get error about no closing quotes

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:09,000
then some other errors

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
if you have problems, always look at the first error

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because it may provoke other errors later on

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
all the errors that follow come from this first error

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the quotes are not closed

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I advise you to correct errors in order

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
so let’s go back to the prior version

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
typing Enter like that does not work

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but there is a special character for a line break, \n

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
now if I compile again

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
oops I forgot to save

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
sorry, I compile again and execute

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have hello world with a line break

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You read line by line, and a ; is the end of a command

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:10,000
for example, I could try to write the following

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on this line I put two different commands

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I asked to display hello pouet as well

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I compile and execute

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and it’s working

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
now if I delete this ; here

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
compile and execute

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and here the compiler displays an error

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
a ; is missing between my two expressions

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you should read what the compiler tells you

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it will help you find your errors

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
my advice is not to put two commands on the same line

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
it’s a lot easier to read if you only put one command per line

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I compile, and we have the exact same result

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you can do this as much as you want

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
here I add a few, compile

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you can see the result

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we have made our first C program

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and you know how to compile C programs

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and have an executable to launch

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
in the next videos we’ll cover many other things

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and you will perfectly understand what I did today

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I’m sure that in a few videos, you will a C professional
